## Eyewear

It's important to have safety eyewear that's both protective and comfortable! Glasses and goggles come in many shapes and sizes and we recommend shopping around to find the perfect fit for you. For flameworking, choose glasses with didymium lenses to cut through the sulfur flare. In other studios, you may want lenses that block UV and IR rays.
