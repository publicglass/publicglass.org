At Public Glass we focus on hands-on learning and small class sizes, with no more than three or four students per instructor. Anyone can jump right into any of our studios with an introductory class. Read on to learn about each type of glassworking and how Public Glass can get you involved!

What should I bring to class?

- Comfortable clothes. We recommend cotton or other natural fibers rather than synthetics and long sleeves to protect your arms.
- Closed toe shoes. No sandals or other open toed shoes are permitted; you must wear work boots or sneakers.
- A water bottle or something to drink, especially in the Hot Shop.
- Something to snack on, especially during long classes.
- An inquiring mind! Glass is a fun, engaging hobby and you will find endless things to inspire you.

## Glassblowing

Glassblowing has been a go-to method for the creation of functional vessels for nearly 3,500 years, but the studio glass movement was born with the advancement of kiln technology in the late 1960s. Glassblowing is all about manipulating very hot, molten glass — it's stored in the furnace at about 2100° and kept between 1600° and 1900°F while working. The liquid glass is "gathered" onto one end of a punty or blowpipe, and then inflated by blowing into the other end of the blowpipe or shaped with wood and metal tools. Though glassblowing can be a challenging and demanding process, the creative possibilities of form and color are endless and highly rewarding. Public Glass offers classes in the core skills of glassblowing, as well as specialty classes in sculpting, interdisciplinary techniques, advanced shaping focuses and more. Ages 14+.

## Flameworking

Flameworking, also known as lampworking or torchworking, is endless in its creative possibility. Similar to glassblowing, but on a smaller scale, flameworking is not as physically demanding, although it does require a degree of eye-hand coordination and concentration. The flameworking set up includes a torch, glass rods and metals tools, such as small molds and tweezers. When they're done, all pieces are cooled slowly to remove the stress. Public Glass offers classes in the core skills of flameworking, as well as specialty classes in vessels, marbles, beads and jewelry, animals and more. Ages 12+.

## Fusing & Slumping

Fusing & slumping is one way of creating kilnformed or warm glass. At its most simple, the process involves cutting and layering pieces of glass at room temperature, and heating them over time in a kiln until they soften, fuse and bend into simple molds. The process lends itself to functional pieces, such as dishes, jewelry, frames, tiles and plaques, as well as wall art and sculptural items. Fusing & slumping is perfect for more the meticulous and patient, and allows for very complex and colorful work without the heat of the hot or flame shops. Public Glass offers classes in the core skills of fusing & slumping, as well as specialty classes in mosaics, deep imagery and more. Ages 12+.

## Coldworking

Coldworking helps make glass from any other studio shine. By cutting, grinding and polishing with equipment cooled with plenty of water, glass pieces can be elevated to their fullest potential, or salvaged if something went wrong somewhere else! Public glass offers classes in the core skills of coldworking, as well as specialty classes in sandblasting, etching and more. Ages 14+.

## Kilncasting

Kilncasting is an easy way to manipulate solid glass into any almost any shape, usually working with plaster molds. After selecting a mold or making one from scratch by "investing" another object as a model, the mold can be filled with small bits of glass and placed into the kiln. At a very high temperature, usually about 1500° to 1800°F, the glass will become molten and fill the mold. Public Glass offers classes in the core skills of kilncasting, as well as specialty classes in pâte de verre, lost wax casting and more. Ages 14+.

## Hotcasting

Hotcasting is to kilncasting as glassblowing is to fusing & slumping — hotter, faster and more hands-on! In hotcasting, a mold is prepared by making a tight impression with an object in a container of specially prepared sand. Color can be added by lining the surface with colored glass powders and then molten glass is ladled straight into the mold at 2200°F and set into a kiln to cool. Public Glass offers classes in the core skills of hotcasting, as well as specialty classes in production, interdisclipinary techniques and more. Ages 14+.

## Experience Glass Team Building Events

Public Glass is proud to present the opportunity for large groups to experience the enticing medium of hot furnace glass. From team building sessions to just playing with hot molten glass, we offer a tailored experience for your group to bond and create their own art glass piece. Events at Public Glass are a lot of fun and very memorable, and Experience Glass is a great opportunity to expose yourself and your colleagues to this unique art form, while focusing on teamwork, problem solving and creativity.

We generally accomodate groups of 6-10 people. Please call for larger parties. In the 3-hour session, you will learn to gather glass from the furnace and manipulate this molten medium into an object, such as a flower or paperweight. In a more extensive 6-hour session, you will have the opportunity to understand what is involved in blowing glass; participants will be given the chance to create their own drinking glass or small vessel. $85 per person for a 3 Hour Session; $195 per person for a 6 Hour Session.

Please call or [email us to set up your session](mailto:operations@publicglass.org&subject=Experience%20Glass)!
