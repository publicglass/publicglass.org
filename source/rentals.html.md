Every one of our studios can be rented for work on personal projects. Because safety is a top priority, we require renters to complete basic skill-building classes or demonstrate the relevant experience to PG staff. At Public Glass, the minimum experience to rent is:

We recommend you mark or label any of your own tools brought into the studio to avoid confusion. The cost to repair or replace any damaged equipment resulting from misuse will be billed. Special requests or projects can be accommodated, but must be discussed with the facilities manager beforehand.

## Hot Shop

Rentals in the Hot Shop are generally booked in three hour increments, called "blow slots", and cost $160 for non-members, $140 for members, $130 for silver members and $120 for gold members per bench. Rental includes approximately 2 sq. feet of annealer floor space, access to basic tools  — jacks, shears, paddles, blocks, pipes and punties — and use of the equipment outlined below. A whole private annealer can be booked in advance for $50 per day, and use of a Venturi propane torch can be booked for $10 an hour. We allot 25 lbs. of glass per blow slot; sn additional 1.25¢ a pound will be charged for more than 25 lbs. Hot casting is occasionally scheduled and open for rental; as this is particularly material-intensive, please contact us to determine the needs of your project.
