> *We recommend you mark or label any of your own tools brought into the studio to avoid confusion. The cost to repair or replace any damaged equipment resulting from misuse will be billed. Special requests or projects can be accommodated, but must be discussed with the facilities manager beforehand.

Use the links below to view availability and request appointments in each of our shops via the online calendar. Appointment requests must be submitted at least 48 hours in advance of the desired rental. Last-minute rental requests must be submitted by email to: [rentals@publicglass.org](mailto:rentals@publicglass.org?subject=Last%20Minute%20Rental). This email should include your full name, the date(s) and times of your requested slot(s), the resource(s) you wish to book, and any add-on services such as the garage, extra annealing space, etc. You will receive an email confirmation usually within 24 hours.

## Hot Shop

Rentals in the Hot Shop are generally booked in three hour increments, called "blow slots", and cost $160 for non-members, $140 for members, $130 for silver members and $120 for gold members, per bench. Rental includes approximately 2 sq. feet of annealer floor space, access to basic tools  — jacks, shears, paddles, blocks, pipes, punties and Mapp gas torches — and use of the equipment outlined below. We allot 25 lbs. of glass per blow slot; an additional 1.25¢ a pound will be charged for more than 25 lbs. Hot casting is occasionally scheduled and open for rental; as this is particularly material-intensive, please contact us to determine the needs of your project.
