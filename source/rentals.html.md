Every one of our studios can be rented for work on personal projects. Because safety is a top priority, we require renters to complete basic skill-building classes or demonstrate their relevant experience to PG staff. At Public Glass, the minimum experience to rent is:

Special requests or projects can be accommodated, but must be discussed with the facilities manager beforehand.

## Hot Shop

Rentals in the Hot Shop are generally booked in three hour increments, called "blow slots", and cost $160 for non-members, $140 for members, $130 for silver members and $120 for gold members per bench. Rental includes approximately 2 sq. feet of annealer floor space, access to basic tools  — jacks, shears, paddles, blocks, pipes, punties and Mapp gas torches — and use of the equipment outlined below. A whole private annealer can be booked in advance for $50 per day, and use of a Venturi propane torch or the garage can be booked for $10 each per slot. We allot 25 lbs. of glass per blow slot; an additional 1.25¢ a pound will be charged for more than 25 lbs. Hot casting is occasionally scheduled and open for rental; as this is particularly material-intensive, please contact us to determine the needs of your project.
