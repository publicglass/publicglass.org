<p><strong>Hot Glass Cold Beer</strong> is our favorite long-running event, combining glass demonstrations, live music and light refreshments. For a $25 donation, you can select your own hand-blown glass to drink your fill of beer or wine, and take it home when the evening is over! As an added bonus, save 10% off all classes and workshops when you register during the event! (Glasses are available while supplies last.)</p>
