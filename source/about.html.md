## Facilities & Gallery

Public Glass operates four studios for glassblowing, flameworking, kilnworking and coldworking. For details on our equipment, please see [rentals](/rentals).

We also have a small gallery on site that frequently features work from our artists. The gallery is available for art shows, as well as public and private events. If you are an artist interested in showing work at Public Glass, [please contact us](mailto:nate@publicglass.org?subject=Gallery).

## Support Public Glass

### Volunteering

“It takes a village” to operate and maintain a non-profit glass studio, and that's why Public Glass could always use a few extra hands! We're always looking for volunteers for Hot Glass Cold Beer and other events, as well as assistance with ongoing and project-based tasks that keep PG running smoothly. If you'd like to help out, we'd love to have you. [Please contact us to get involved!](mailto:nate@publicglass.org?subject=Volunteering)

### Giving

As a small, local, non-profit studio, Public Glass needs support to sustain its studio and educational programs, and you can help! [Please click to contribute with a tax deductible donation and strengthen our facility and programs.][2] If you'd like to make other arrangements or donate toward a specific goal, [please contact us](mailto:nate@publicglass.org?subject=Giving). Public Glass is a 501(c)(3) charity; Tax ID number 94-3253918.

### Wish List

Help make Public Glass even better! Our programs are equipment-intensive and all of it constantly gets good, hard use. Any and all donated items will go directly to maintaining and improving our facility and expanding our programs. If you're able to donate something not on the list, we may be able to put it into service!  All donations are completely tax-deductible, and we can arrange to pick-up if you are unable to drop-off. Thank you for your support!
