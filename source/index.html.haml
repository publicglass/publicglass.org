[Hot Glass Cold Beer](https://www.facebook.com/events/447543552003205/) will kick off early on Saturday, May 18th at a special time of 5pm for a gallery opening with the artists. They will be combining their creative talents and working together to create a dynamic & exciting site-specific installation using mixed-media and objects made here at Public Glass. The show will be open to the public through June 15 during normal gallery hours.

    Our Light a Spark youth program is gaining momentum! We recently had the pleasure of hosting a group of students from several 3rd Street youth organizations for a round of solid sculpted paperweights and fused tiles. We still need your support to continue to bring this unique and creative experience to a young person who would not have the opportunity otherwise, so [please give what you can as a tax deductible donation](https://www.networkforgood.org/donation/MakeDonation.aspx?ORGID2=943253918&vlrStratCode=HvqfFy2sp40gpxt2AIpqCzpuQuFA5jIPZnlYD%2ff6VwxTqydaQU1Bq1kUDAStx7rq).

    We're adding new classes every week, for those who are new to glass as well as those looking to take things to the next level. Take a look at our [class roster](http://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ws.asp?studioid=33642&stype=-7) for the latest information.
