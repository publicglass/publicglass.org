    ## News

    In just a few days, acclaimed sculptors Karen Willenbrink-Johnsen and Jasen Johnsen will join us for a week of workshops, ending in a very special [Hot Glass Cold Beer and silent auction on February 23](http://www.facebook.com/events/500208783351844/), to help raise funds for our new at-risk-youth program, *Light a Spark*. Glassblowing isn’t just a creative medium, it’s a process that teaches life lessons and instills confidence through collaboration, sustained focus and constant improvement toward mastery. We look forward to partnering with youth organizations in the Bayview to bring the experience of glass to under-served youth in our community.

    General admission for Karen Willenbrink-Johnsen and Jasen Johnsen's demonstration is available for a $25 donation at the door, and [select seating will be available in advance for a $50 donation](http://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ws.asp?studioid=33642&stype=43&sCat=99999).

    If you are unable to attend the event and would like to contribute toward bringing a unique creative experience to a young person who would not have the opportunity otherwise, [please give what you can as a tax deductible donation](https://www.networkforgood.org/donation/MakeDonation.aspx?ORGID2=943253918&vlrStratCode=HvqfFy2sp40gpxt2AIpqCzpuQuFA5jIPZnlYD%2ff6VwxTqydaQU1Bq1kUDAStx7rq).

    We're adding new classes every week, for those who are new to glass as well as those looking to take things to the next level. Take a look at our [class roster](http://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ws.asp?studioid=33642&stype=-7) for the latest information.
