    ## News

    Happy New Year! We're rebuilding, updating and polishing the studio to a shine for our reopening on January 10th, and we're very excited about some of the things we already have lined up for 2013. Take a look at our [class roster](http://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ws.asp?studioid=33642&stype=-7) - and a new system that will make it easier than ever to enroll - and clear your calendar for our upcoming Hot Glass Cold Beer season.

    In February we'll be welcoming master sculptors Karen Willenbrink-Johnsen and Jasen Johnsen into the studio for a three day sculpting intensive, an open studios day and a Hot Glass Cold Beer, to boot!
