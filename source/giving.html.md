Public Glass needs your help today!

In lieu of our Spring 2013 auction, Public Glass is now reaching out to our members, community and admirers for your support through donations. Every contribution helps sustain the vast resources required to provide glass blowing, casting, fusing and flameworking to the Bay Area community.
 
As a small arts nonprofit we strive to keep glass making available to professional artists and enthusiasts alike. We provide a diverse array of programming, including our new youth program, *[Light a Spark](/classes#toc_9)*, where kids can create and learn team building while gaining confidence and skills through working with glass.

Your generous donation will allow Public Glass to continue to promote creativity and education in glass to a larger audience and build a stronger presence within the arts community.  Public Glass is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  All or a portion of your donation may be tax-deductible as prescribed by law.
 
Please help us keep glass alive in the Bay Area by making your donation today. Click the link below, or mail a check payable to Public Glass to: 

**Public Glass**  
1750 Armstrong Avenue  
San Francisco, CA, 94124
 
We greatly appreciate your support.

## Volunteering

“It takes a village” to operate and maintain a non-profit glass studio, and that's why Public Glass could always use a few extra hands! We're always looking for volunteers for Hot Glass Cold Beer and other events, as well as assistance with ongoing and project-based tasks that keep PG running smoothly. If you'd like to help out, we'd love to have you. [Please contact us to get involved!](mailto:nate@publicglass.org?subject=Volunteering)

Help make Public Glass even better! Our programs are equipment-intensive and all of it constantly gets good, hard use. Any and all donated items will go directly to maintaining and improving our facility and expanding our programs. If you're able to donate something not on the list, we may be able to put it into service!  All donations are completely tax-deductible, and we can arrange to pick-up if you are unable to drop-off.
